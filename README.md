# Docugami KG-RAG Template with Langchain

## About this Project

This project comes with the `docugami-kg-rag` template preinstalled in the packages. This template contains a reference architecture for Retrieval Augmented Generation against a set of documents using Docugami's XML Knowledge Graph (KG-RAG).

## Setup

Please follow the steps in setting up the `docugami-kg-rag` template [here](packages/docugami-kg-rag/README.md).

We heavily recommend creating a [virtual environment](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) when working with our project.

After creating your virtual environment, you can install dependencies by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

You need to set some required environment variables before using your new app based on this template. These are used to index as well as run the application, and exceptions are raised if the following required environment variables are not set:

1. `OPENAI_API_KEY`: from the OpenAI platform.
2. `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY`: from the [Docugami Developer Playground](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export DOCUGAMI_API_KEY=...
```

## Adding more packages

```bash
# adding packages from 
# https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/templates
langchain app add $PROJECT_NAME

# adding custom GitHub repo packages
langchain app add --repo $OWNER/$REPO
# or with whole git string (supports other git providers):
# langchain app add git+https://github.com/hwchase17/chain-of-verification

# with a custom api mount point (defaults to `/{package_name}`)
langchain app add $PROJECT_NAME --api_path=/my/custom/path/rag
```

Note: you remove packages by their api path

```bash
langchain app remove my/custom/path/rag
```

## Setup LangSmith (Optional)
LangSmith will help us trace, monitor and debug LangChain applications. 
LangSmith is currently in private beta, you can sign up [here](https://smith.langchain.com/). 
If you don't have access, you can skip this section


```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
export LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=<your-project>  # if not specified, defaults to "default"
```

## Running the project

Before the project can work, you'll have to index your Docugami docsets.

```bash
poetry run index

1: Master Services Agreements (ID: d6aubexzhf5c)
2: Non-Disclosure Agreements (ID: j3ms43eg302p)
3: Earnings Calls (ID: f46vx4fcmxac)

Please enter the number(s) of the docset(s) to index (comma-separated) or 'all' to index all docsets:
```

Note that indexing may take awhile, especially with larger docsets.

Once you're done creating your index, launch your project with:

```bash
poetry run langchain serve
```
