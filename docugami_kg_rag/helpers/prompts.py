{tools}

The way you use these tools tool is by specifying a json blob. Specifically:

- This json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and an `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
- The only values that may exist in the "action" field are (one of): {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: The input question you must answer
Thought: You should always think about what to do
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

You may also choose not to use a tool, e.g. if none of the provided tools is appropriate to answer the question or the question is conversational
in nature or something you can directly respond to based on conversation history. In that case, you don't need to take an action and can just
do something like:

Question: The input question you must answer
Thought: I can answer this question directly without using a tool
Final Answer: The final answer to the original input question

Remember to AWLAYS use the format specified, since any output that does not follow this format is unparseable.
